- I am having issues with a MRobotics M8N ublox GPS module. The current version of Mission planner 1.3.77 and U Center V22.05 are different enough that the older instructions of how to link GPS to Pixhawk Cube orange in Mission Planner on Ardupilot wiki page are not current and I can not get the GPS to transmit to Mission planner throug the Pixhawk.
